# Chicago (USA) Analysis

The core questions needed to be answer in this project are:

> What are the most common crime types and which ones lead to the most arrests in Chicago?

> Which community areas and districts are the most crime-concentrated?

> How does school safety and college enrollment vary across Chicago's community areas?

> Is there a relationship between a community area's school safety score and its per capita income?

## Dataset Overview

A Chicago SQL analysis datasets, including crime reports, public school performance, and socioeconomic indicators, which explores crime patterns, school safety and enrollment, and the relationship between neighborhood income and community outcomes.

These dump datasets are provided in the course ["SQL: A Practical Introduction for Querying Databases"](https://www.coursera.org/learn/sql-practical-introduction-for-querying-databases) by IBM on Coursera.
